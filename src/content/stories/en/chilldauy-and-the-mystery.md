Once upon a time, long before humans existed, there was a peaceful capybara named Chilldauy. He spent his days exactly as his name suggested—chilling by the river, basking in the sun, and enjoying the gentle sounds of the forest.
<br>
<br>
One day, his rest was interrupted by a soft whimper. Sleepily, he opened his eyes and saw something strange floating on a large lily pad in the middle of the lake. It was a tiny human baby! The helpless little creature stared up at him with big, curious eyes.
<br>
<br>
Chilldauy had never seen anything like this before. But he had a kind heart, and he knew he had to help. He carefully pulled the baby to shore and brought it to his neighbor, Biberus, a wise and generous beaver. <strong>“Biberus, can the baby stay with you tonight?” </strong>he asked. The beaver nodded. <strong>“Of course, my friend. I will take care of it.”</strong>
<br>
<br>
The next morning, something strange happened. The baby had already grown! It seemed to have a mysterious power. Chilldauy realized he needed to find out where it belonged.
<br>
<br>
He carried the baby to the shore, where a woman sat, calling the name “Kuja” over and over again. At that moment, Chilldauy understood—the baby’s name must be Kuja! Was this his mother? He watched as the woman discovered the baby, scooped him up in her arms, and cried tears of joy.
<br>
<br>
Satisfied that the baby was safe, Chilldauy slipped back into the forest, knowing he had helped a lost soul find its way home.
<br>
<br>
But what he didn’t know was that Kuja was no ordinary child. He had a deep connection to nature, and his meeting with the capybara was only the beginning of a much greater adventure…
<br>
<br>
The End? Or just the beginning?
