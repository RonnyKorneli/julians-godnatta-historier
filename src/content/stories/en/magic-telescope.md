summary: "Two friends discover a magical telescope that lets them see stars even in the middle of the day. Excited by the gift, they are soon caught up in a disagreement over who it truly belongs to. When the telescope is stolen, they must put aside their differences and work together to get it back."

Deep in a forest lived Bear Bjørn and Mouse Milla. They were good friends, even though they were very different. Bjørn was big and strong, while Milla was small and quick. Together, they explored the forest and shared everything—until the day a mysterious package arrived.
<br>
<br>

The package had a note:"For Bear Bjørn and Mouse Milla. This telescope is magical—it lets you see stars and planets even in the middle of the day. Take good care of it!"
It had been sent by Bjørn's brother, who lived far away. Bjørn and Milla were excited and carefully unpacked it. It was a beautiful telescope, decorated with golden patterns and a lens that sparkled in the sunlight.
But their joy didn’t last long.

"It’s from my brother, so it belongs to me!" Bjørn said, stomping proudly."Your brother? He sent it to both of us!" protested Milla.
The argument grew louder and louder. Finally, Bjørn used his strength, lifted the telescope, and said:"I’m the strongest. I should keep it safe."
He carried the telescope into his den and placed it on a shelf. Milla was angry and upset but said nothing.

## The Mischievous Magpie

<br>

Late at night, as the moon shone over the forest, something unexpected happened. The mischievous magpie, known for stealing anything shiny, woke up in her nest. She had seen the telescope earlier that day and couldn’t resist the temptation.
The magpie flew straight into Bjørn’s den. The door was wide open—Bjørn had forgotten to close it. She grabbed the telescope with her claws and quickly flew back to her nest.
When morning came, Bjørn discovered the theft and growled with anger."The telescope is gone!"
Milla heard him and said dryly:"Well, it wasn’t so safe with you after all."
Bjørn looked guilty but turned to Milla with a hopeful glint in his eye."We need to get it back. The magpie must have taken it. Will you help me?"
Milla smirked. "Only if we share it once we get it back."
Bjørn nodded. "Deal."

## Teamwork and Courage

<br>

Together, they planned how to sneak into the magpie’s nest, which was high up in an old oak tree. Bjørn lifted Milla onto his back, and she climbed further up to the branch where the telescope lay. The magpie was sound asleep, so Milla could retrieve the telescope without any trouble.
When they returned to the den, they sat down to use the telescope together. They gazed at stars and planets and realized something important.
"We are strongest when we work together," Bjørn said."And it’s much more fun to share," Milla added.
From that day on, they shared the telescope—and never argued again.
