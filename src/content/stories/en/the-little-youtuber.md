Once upon a time, there was a boy named Max who had a big dream: he wanted to become a famous YouTuber. Every night before he went to sleep, Max imagined himself making videos that thousands of people would watch. He loved playing games and telling funny stories. His parents weren’t sure if YouTube was a good idea, but they supported him anyway.

## Santaclause

<br>

One winter, just before Christmas, Max wrote a letter to Santa Claus:“Dear Santa, I don’t need toys this year. All I want is a YouTube setup so I can make my dream come true.”
On Christmas morning, Max woke up and ran excitedly to the Christmas tree. There was a large wrapped gift with his name on it. When he tore off the wrapping paper, he couldn’t believe his eyes: a camera, a microphone, and even a ring light! A small note was attached:
"Dear Max, dream big and work hard. Your creativity will inspire the world.— Santa Claus"
<br>
<br>

From that moment on, Max began working on his dream. His first videos weren’t perfect, and at first, he only had a few viewers. But Max never gave up. After school, he learned how to edit videos, create better content, and share his ideas. Month by month, his channel grew until he finally reached the magical milestone of 100,000 subscribers.

## Youtube button gets stolen

<br>

His classmates were thrilled and congratulated him. But there was one boy named Torben who was jealous. Torben wanted to be famous too and felt bad because he thought he’d never be as successful as Max.
One day, Torben secretly stole Max’s YouTube Play Button, which Max proudly displayed on his shelf. But Torben quickly felt guilty.
<br>
<br>

When Max noticed his Play Button was missing, he was upset. He heard from a friend that Torben had taken it. Instead of getting angry, Max decided to talk to him.
“Torben,” Max said kindly, “I know you took my Play Button. Why did you do it?”
Torben looked down. “I just wanted to feel special. You’re so successful, and I have nothing.”
Max placed a hand on Torben’s shoulder. “You are special, Torben. You have talents, even if you don’t see them. If you want, I can help you start your own channel.”
Torben was surprised. “Do you really mean that?”
<br>
<br>

“Of course,” Max said. “We could even make videos together.”
Torben returned the Play Button, and from that day on, the two became best friends. They worked together, learned from each other, and helped each other grow. Max realized that success isn’t just about achieving your own goals but also about helping others reach theirs.
