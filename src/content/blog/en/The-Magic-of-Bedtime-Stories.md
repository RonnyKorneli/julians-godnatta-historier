# The Magic of Bedtime Stories

Reading stories with your children before bedtime is more than just a sweet ritual – it’s a gift that lasts a lifetime. Those quiet moments together strengthen your bond, create a sense of safety, and open the door to meaningful conversations.

Stories fuel your child’s imagination, build their vocabulary, and help them understand emotions and the world around them. The calming rhythm of reading also helps little ones wind down, making it easier for them to drift into peaceful sleep.

So, each night, take a few minutes, open a book, and step together into a world of adventures. The story might end when the light goes out, but the connection you build will last forever.
