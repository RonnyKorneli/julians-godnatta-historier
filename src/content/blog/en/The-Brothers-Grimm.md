# The Brothers Grimm: More Than Fairy Tales

When we think of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, we imagine enchanted forests, talking animals, and darkly magical fairy tales. But the Brothers Grimm were more than storytellers — they were cultural historians. In early 19th-century Germany, a time of political fragmentation and growing nationalism, the brothers saw folk tales as a way to preserve the German language, traditions, and identity.

They traveled through towns and villages, collecting stories passed down orally, often from women who knew them by heart. These tales were not originally “children’s stories” — they were raw, moral, and sometimes frightening, reflecting the struggles, values, and fears of everyday life at the time.

By compiling and publishing these stories, the Brothers Grimm helped shape not only German cultural heritage but also the global imagination. Today, their work reminds us that folklore is more than entertainment — it’s a living record of a people’s hopes, hardships, and sense of wonder.
